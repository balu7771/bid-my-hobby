# Multi-Cloud Cost Optimization: AWS Route 53 + OCI

## Cost Breakdown

### AWS Costs (Route 53 only)
- **Hosted Zone**: $0.50/month per domain
- **DNS Queries**: $0.40 per million queries (first 1 billion)
- **Health Checks**: $0.50/month per health check (optional)

**Total AWS Cost**: ~$1-2/month for DNS only

### OCI Costs (Compute)
- **Always Free Tier**: 
  - 2 AMD-based Compute VMs (1/8 OCPU, 1 GB memory each)
  - 4 Arm-based Ampere A1 cores and 24 GB memory (can be split across VMs)
  - 200 GB total block storage
- **Paid Options**: Starting from ~$5-10/month for small instances

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk Comparison
- **t2.micro (free tier)**: Free for 12 months, then ~$8.5/month
- **t3.small**: ~$15/month
- **Load Balancer**: ~$16/month
- **Total**: $25-40/month

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create OCI Instance
```bash
# Use OCI CLI or console to create instance
oci compute instance launch \
  --availability-domain YOUR_AD \
  --compartment-id YOUR_COMPARTMENT_ID \
  --image-id YOUR_IMAGE_ID \
  --shape VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro \
  --subnet-id YOUR_SUBNET_ID
```

### 2. Configure Route 53
```bash
# Point your domain to OCI instance
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
  --hosted-zone-id YOUR_ZONE_ID \
  --change-batch file://dns-change.json
```

### 3. Deploy Application
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x deploy-to-oci.sh

# Update the script with your OCI instance details
# Then run:
./deploy-to-oci.sh
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Cost Savings**: 60-80% reduction in hosting costs
2. **DNS Reliability**: AWS Route 53 is highly reliable
3. **Flexibility**: Can easily switch between cloud providers
4. **Learning**: Experience with multiple cloud platforms

## Considerations

1. **Network Latency**: Slight increase due to cross-cloud setup
2. **Complexity**: Managing resources across two cloud providers
3. **Support**: Need to understand both AWS and OCI
4. **Data Transfer**: Consider costs if using AWS services for data storage

## Monitoring Setup

Use AWS CloudWatch for DNS monitoring and OCI monitoring for compute resources:

```bash
# Set up Route 53 health checks
aws route53 create-health-check \
  --caller-reference $(date +%s) \
  --health-check-config Type=HTTP,ResourcePath=/actuator/health,FullyQualifiedDomainName=yourdomain.com
```

## Security Best Practices

1. Use OCI security groups to restrict access
2. Set up SSL/TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt is free)
3. Regular security updates on OCI instance
4. Monitor access logs

This approach can save you $20-30/month while maintaining good performance and reliability.
